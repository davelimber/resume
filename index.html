                by cancer connect with others experiencing similar health challenges. Part of this connection is determined
                by a search and filter algorithm which is also being used to identify health disparity trends that third

            <div class="topic-description">I worked as an Engineer developing a security mitigation framework to limit web application vulnerabilities.
                The mitigation was performed by identifying attack vectors and vulnerabilities from third party code. I also
                helped develop a branch of the mitigation framework responsible for tracking and identifying user session
                activity and patterns common with cross-site-scripting attacks. I also helped to write several graphs and
                charts for rendering the data that was collected. I left to work for a startup called Cancer Spot</div>

                also helped develop and implement curriculum and student projects. I finished teaching to move back to Idaho
